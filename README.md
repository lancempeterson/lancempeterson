### Hi, I'm Lance M. Peterson 

I am a Software Engineer II and Mobile App Developer. I have over 5 years of mobile app development experience. I have a degree in Software Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. I am very mobile and I am willing to relocate anywhere in the world where I think there is an opportunity for career growth. I wish to work and collaborate with people from all backgrounds. No goal is too big! For business inquiries or employer interest, please feel free to contact me at lancepeterson50@gmail.com.
